## UX

### Fonts

- I have used Google Fonts to find the font that suits best to the feel of the website. I have used [Cedarville Cursive](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Cedarville+Cursive) for the logo and the main titles and [Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto) for the page contents.

### Icons

- The icons on the website were taken from [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/).

### Colors

- The main colours on the website are brown, white, and dark green. This is because I wanted a simple, clean design with natural colours.
